This is a Completion Plugin for Oh-My-ZSH. 
It faciliates the handling of the openslx and mltk command line tools by 
showing available options, targets, module, hosts and configs on tab press.

#Install
To use it, just place the folder 'openslx' under "~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/",
fire up a new zsh-session, switch to your tm-script directory and the 
completion should be working.

#Optional
The following lines can be added to your ~/.zshrc file
They are not really necessary for the completion to work, but will make 
the completion functions more verbose.
-------------------------------------------------------------
zstyle ':completion:*' verbose yes
zstyle ':completion:*:descriptions' format '%B%d%b'
zstyle ':completion:*:messages' format '%d'
zstyle ':completion:*:warnings' format 'No matches for: %d'
zstyle ':completion:*' group-name ‚Äù
-------------------------------------------------------------

#Development
With the following command you can quickly test changes you did to the 
completion functions without having to reopen a new session every time. 
For example to reload the completion function for _mltk:

$ unfunction _mltk && autoload -U _mltk

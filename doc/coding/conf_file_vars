Directory of variables used in module conf- and build files.

Please expand and keep up to date!


These main variables will be used by remote/setup_target directly. They
can therefore be used directly without further build script logic.
Note: REQUIRED_BINARIES and REQUIRED_FILES will only be searched for in the
module's own build directory!

REQUIRED_BINARIES		List of binaries to copy
REQUIRED_FILES			List of regular files to copy
REQUIRED_DIRECTORIES		List of directories to copy
REQUIRED_SYSTEM_FILES		Files to be copied directly from the system
REQUIRED_INSTALLED_PACKAGES	List of packages needed at build-time
REQUIRED_CONTENT_PACKAGES	List of packages where the contents are to be
				copied
REQUIRED_LIBRARIES              Gathers required libraries. Note: These will
				only be searched below module build directory.
				Used in beamergui, consolekit, kdm, kernel, pam,
				polkit, sshd, vbox, xorg.
REQUIRED_MODULES		Denotes module dependencies: Modules which need
				to be built before building a module.
				Used in dnbd3, ldm-gtk-greeter.


These main variables will be used by a helper script. They therefore do not need
specialized build script logic.

REQUIRED_LDD_BLACKLIST		Blacklist to not search for unwanted libraries,
				evaluated by binutil.inc.
				Used by kdm and vbox configuration.
REQUIRED_PACKET_FILES_BLACKLIST	Blacklist to exclude files from listed package files,
				eg. in case a rpm declares a file, but not extract it.
				Note: Several entries needed to be separated by "\|"!
				Used by samba.


These variables take middle ground: They are neither used by helper script nor
remote/setup_target. They do need to be called in build scripts in some sense, e.g.
as parameter for configure when compiling.

REQUIRED_PREFIX			Used to deliver wanted prefix-option to
				'configure' script for compiling some source.


Locally used variables, using extended build scripts. These vars need own build
script logic to word, but may be globalized some day:

REQUIRED_GIT			Required git URL for source download via git.
				Used in beamergui, busybox, dnbd3, printergui,
				Redsocks, vmchooser.
REQUIRED_BRANCH			Required branch for source version via git.
				Used in busybox.
REQUIRED_COMMIT			Denoted a needed git commit by hash.
				Used in dnbd3.
REQUIRED_DIR_STRUCT		Root of directory structures directly needed from system.
				Used in polkit configuration for ubuntu/debian.
REQUIRED_DISABLED_SERVICES	List of systemd services to disable specifically.
				Used in systemd configuration.
REQUIRED_DOWNLOAD_BASE		Base url for downloading package.
				Used in vmware configuration.
REQUIRED_LIBKMOD_URL		Base URL and version for libkmod compilation.
REQUIRED_LIBKMOD_VERSION	Used in systemd configuration.
REQUIRED_PAM_SCRIPT_URL		Denotes needed pam URL, depends on
				REQUIRED_PAM_SCRIPT_VERSION.
				Used in pam.
REQUIRED_PAM_SCRIPT_VERSION	Denotes needed pam Version.
				Used in pam.
REQUIRED_REVISION		Denoted a needed git commit by hash.
				Used in redsocks. Seems to be the same as
				REQUIRED_COMMIT; these will be standardized later.
REQUIRED_TYPE			Denotes either vmware-workstation or vmware-player
				in download URL construction.
				Used in vmware.
REQUIRED_URL			Denotes URL of some package to be downloaded. This
				variable name should be used for this purpose.
				Used in systemd, plymouth.
REQUIRED_VBOXBASEURL		Denotes URL of virtual box base package (not
				Expansion Pack).
				Used in vbox.
REQUIRED_VBOXEXTURL		Denotes URL of virtual box Expansion Pack package
				Used in vbox.
REQUIRED_VERSION		Denotes version number of some package, mostly
				used as part of a download URL. Thise variable
				name should be used by standard.
				Used in plymouth, systemd.


These variables are only used in the unsuccessful configurations for Scientific
Linux, mostly (version) dependencies for systemd. They denote source URLS and
needed versions for systemd necessities, which were not versionally met by
Scientific Linux.

REQUIRED_AUTOCONF_URL, REQUIRED_AUTOCONF_VERSION, REQUIRED_AUTOMAKE_URL,
REQUIRED_AUTOMAKE_VERSION, REQUIRED_DBUS_VERSION, REQUIRED_DBUS_URL,
REQUIRED_M4_URL, REQUIRED_M4_VERSION, REQUIRED_UTILLINUX_URL,
REQUIRED_UTILLINUX_VERSION

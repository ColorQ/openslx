Howto mltk localization system - config.tgz


1. General aspects

The localization system is divided into config modules analogue to mltk build 
modules. For differentiation these modules do not use the 'remote' directory 
hierarchy but are to be found in the 'server' directory hierarchy at 
.../tm-scripts/server/modules.


2. Naming convention

Of course these modules, if being newly written, can be named at will, as 
they will be included by links later on. Anyway we would recommend to follow 
our established naming scheme to produce informative names.

We recommend to use dual branched names connected by hyphens. First part of 
the name should be the system part to be changed; the second part should 
denominate the place/location the change applies to.

For example a module changing PAM for the needs of the university of Freiburg 
should be named pam-freiburg (as it is), or pam-uni_freiburg, or perhaps even 
pam-uni_freiburg_rz.


3. Module activation

mltk expects different configurations (localizations) in the directory tree 
at .../tm-scripts/server/configs/. The name of a subdirectory there will be 
used as parameter for mltk to pack a local configuration later on.

So let's use the configuration 'freiburg' as an example. As mentioned the 
configuration directory would be .../tm-scripts/server/configs/freiburg. The 
modules for that configuration reside in .../tm-scripts/server/modules. These 
modules needed are, then, activated by links:
branding-freiburg -> ../../modules/branding-freiburg/,
cups-freiburg -> ../../modules/cups-freiburg/,
pam-freiburg -> ../../modules/pam-freiburg/
etc.


4. Module internals

As said the modules have their place at server/modules/[module name]. It is 
compulsive to mirror the system directory structure exactly. If, for example, 
the module pam-freiburg of configuration freiburg includes a file ldap.conf, 
this file must be placed at 
.../tm-scripts/server/modules/freiburg/pam-freiburg/etc/ldap.conf. 


5. About Packaging / Packing

The directories linked as mentioned above will be archived directory by 
directory using tar and gzip (.tgz). The single archives will be merged 
using tar's append function. 
It is important to note that, if a file occurs more than once or otherwise 
conflicts, mltk will output a warning and then terminate.


6. Usage

A given IP adress is used for determining the placing of an archive, as IP 
adresses are reflected in directory structure (see doc/setup_howto for 
examples). 

By the way, [config-name] is the name of the configuration directory located 
in .../tm-scripts/server/configs/, to be entered without preceding path. 

So executing
# ./mltk server [IP-Adress or 'local'] -k [config-name]
will yield a config.tgz placed in 
.../tm-scripts/server/boot/[IP/local]/configs/[dirname]/config.tgz.

This config.tgz file should be copied to or linked in the appropriate boot 
web server directory.


7. Caveat

Is it important to keep in mind that 
- exactly the same paths as in the system are used in config module folders,
  so no usage of data directories or the like is allowed, and, 
- if a file appears in the system, e.g. in Stage 3.2, it will be overwritten 
  at boot time by a file having the same name and path file from config.tgz.

This directory contains blacklists of files and directories that
should be excluded when cloning stage4 of a remote system. The
blacklists are split into groups, represented by sub-directories.
They contain one or more text files representing blacklists in rsync
"--exclude-from" format.

There is a group called "essential", containg blacklists for essential
files and dirs that you always want to exclude from being cloned.
Other directories are create for specific software packages, like
gnome, or kde.

For inclusion of desktop environments like Gnome or KDE a substructure
(subdirectory) called desktop-sessions was introduced. The files /
directories in there should describe only includes ("+ ....") to provide
files needed for a desktop environment.
